# Dual Gate Delay

A dual gate delay module in the Eurorack format. The module is implemented with an ATTiny13a microcontroller, with features including

* delays ranging from about 8ms to 2s
* gate pulse length is maintined
* sequences of up to 4 pulses can be delayed

A second, fully analog design is also described. This design is based on a current mirror and integration capacitor, and also maintains the gate pulse length. I have not implemented and tested this one.
